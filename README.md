# sports_charities_portfolio
The analysis documents for an ongoing investigation on sports charities.

The project looks at the finances of all the sports charities across the US and Canada, investigating elements that draw attention or seem off.

These particular notebooks were made to serve as the "backbone" of the coding process. Since the actual project involves large-scale collaboration, these notebooks were made so other journalists could analyze them and quickly draw their conclusions. As this project involves many journalists who are not familiar with code, the notebooks are heavily commented throughout. A values dictionary is also included for the same purpose.

This code belongs to a larger set of data related to sports charities. This section was partitioned off to be used in a portfolio.

This project is currently in progress and awaiting publication. Do not under any circumstances share this repo or data with anyone.
