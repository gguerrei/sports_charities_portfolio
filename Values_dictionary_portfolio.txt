Hello! This is meant to be an explanation of all the values I used in my analysis file. Here they are:

df = This is a datafame for the original excel file, with all of its thousands of columns

profit_filtered = a series value holding true and false values for which charities were profitable (True if profitable, False if not)

df_filtered = a dataframe version of the profit_filtered series

team_names_column = a temporary value meant to store the team name's column from the original dataframe so I can insert it into df_filtered

df_true_profit = a dataframe created from df_filtered with only the charities that were profitable

df_true_loss = a dataframe created from df_filtered with only the charities that weren't profitable

total_revenue_column = a temporary value meant to store the total revenue column from the original dataframe so I can insert it into df_filtered

total_expenses_column = a temporary value meant to store the total expenses column from the original dataframe so I can insert it into df_filtered

df_true_profit_revenue_median = a dataframe created so I could calculate the median revenue value of profitable charities

df_true_profit_expenses_median = a dataframe created so I could calculate the median expenses value of profitable charities

df_true_loss_revenue_median = a dataframe created so I could calculate the median revenue value of unprofitable charities

df_true_loss_expenses_median = a dataframe created so I could calculate the median expenses value of unprofitable charities

team_league_column = a temporary value meant to store the team's league column from the original dataframe so I can insert it into df_filtered

df_filtered_mlb = a dataframe with only MLB teams 

df_filtered_nba = a dataframe with only NBA teams 

df_filtered_nfl = a dataframe with only NFL teams 

df_filtered_nhl = a dataframe with only NHL teams 

tax_year_column = a temporary value meant to store the tax year column from the original dataframe so I can insert it into df_filtered and others

profit_amount_column = a temporary value meant to store the profit amount from df_true_profit so I can add those values to that dataframe

loss_amount_column = a temporary value meant to store the loss amount from df_true_loss so I can add those values to that dataframe

region_column = a temporary value meant to store the region column from the original dataframe so I can insert it into df_filtered

df_filtered_west = a dataframe with only teams from the west 

df_filtered_south = a dataframe with only teams from the south 

df_filtered_midwest = a dataframe with only teams from the midwest 

df_filtered_northeast = a dataframe with only teams from the northeast 

df_updated = a dataframe for the updated excel file. still full of columns

df_updated_filtered = a series value telling me which teams spent more on other expenses than on donations. returns true/false values for all teams on df_updated

teams_more_expenses = a dataframe version of the previous series

teams_more_expenses_true = a dataframe that only shows the teams who had "True" attached to them in the previous dataframe. In other words, only the teams that spent more on other expenses than on donations

team_names_column_updated = df_updated['Team name'] = a temporary value meant to store the team name's column from the original dataframe so I can insert it into teams_more_expenses_true

other_expenses_column = df_updated['Other Expenses (I - 17)'] = a temporary value meant to store the other expenses value column from the original dataframe so I can insert it into teams_more_expenses_true

donations_column = df_updated['Functional Expenses - Grants and other assistance to domestic organizations and domestic governments, Total Expenses, Column A (Part IX1)'] = a temporary value meant to store the donations value column from the original dataframe so I can insert it into teams_more_expenses_true

tax_year_column_updated = df_updated['Tax year (the year in the top right corner)'] = a temporary value meant to store the tax year column from the original dataframe so I can insert it into teams_more_expenses_true
